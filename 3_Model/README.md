# Model Definition and Evaluation

In this stage, we define, implement, and evaluate the Neural Network for this project. The aim is to achieve a better performance than the baseline model by trying out different approaches.

## Contents

- **Model Selection**: Different architectures were tried. The most successful one is documented in chapter 6.

- **Feature Engineering**: Most of it was done and documented in Data Preparation. Additional efforts can be found in chapter 3.

- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: These decisions are done in chapter 6 before the start of the training.

- **Implementation**: The printout of the progress takes the rest of chapter 6.

- **Evaluation Metrics**: A diagram shows the decrease of the loss function, and MAPE is calculated in chapter 7.

## Conclusion

Many things were tried out to find improvement. The version of the file that in the end proved to produce the best performing model is documented with this notebook. The success of this model can be seen in the fact that the MAPE on the Validation Data (17.93%) is only a little higher than the MAPE on the Training Data (16.21%).
